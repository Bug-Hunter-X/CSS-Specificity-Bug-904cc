The CSS code has a specificity issue.  The more specific selector is overriding the less specific one, resulting in unexpected styling. For example:

```css
div p { color: blue; }
.special p { color: red; }
<div class="special">
  <p>This text will be red.</p>
</div>
```
The `.special p` selector is more specific because it uses a class selector which takes precedence over the `div p` selector resulting in the text being red instead of blue.
